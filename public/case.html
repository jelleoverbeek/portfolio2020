    <h2>Abstract To Do app</h2>
    <p>
      When working with Abstract we made use of the design review feature. While
      this feature was pretty useful in general I was struggling with one thing:
      having a clear overview of all the given feedback and being able to check
      them off. When Abstract released their SDK I used this to create an app to
      solve this problem and learn how to use Electron and React.
