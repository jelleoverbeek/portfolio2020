        <p>
          The event page of TicketSwap is the most viewed on the platform. On
          this page listings thousands of fans are trying to get a ticket to
          their favourite show. Jim and I worked together on the UX and I
          finished the UI and led the implementation of the design. By
          researching Hotjar, conducting a survey, digging through the
          testimonials and the contact moments with our support team we composed
          those goals:

          <h4>Goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Refresh UI of the page</li>
            <li>Simplify ticket alert behaviour</li>
            <li>
              Decrease questions of users where there newly created listings
              are.
            </li>
            <li>Make users aware that refreshing doesn’t help.</li>

            This is the page where users spend a lot of time trying to get a
            ticket. To create trust and make the page feel personal we show
            avatars of the sellers. The comments that sellers can add to their
            listing sometimes create funny situations that get shared on social
            media.

          <h4>The user's listing</h4>
          <p>
            Users with ticket alerts enabled will first receive a notification
            once a new listing is created, the listing won’t be visible on the
            event page immediately. We do this to combat bots and increase app
            downloads. When doing our research we discovered that sellers went
            to the event page to check their listing and couldn’t see it yet,
            this resulted in a lot of users contacting support. To solve this
            issue without giving bots a chance and hurting the app downloads
            conversion we will now show the newly created to the seller only.

          <p>
            As I mentioned above a lot of people are refreshing the event page
            hoping they will get a ticket. The chance of getting a ticket this
            way is very low because we notify people with ticket alerts enabled
            first. To educate people about this and increase app downloads we
            show this dialog after a few refreshes of a single event page.
