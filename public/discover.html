      <p>
        The event page of TicketSwap is the most viewed on the platform. On this page listings thousands of fans are
        trying to get a ticket to their favourite show. Jim and I worked together on the UX and I finished the UI and
        led the implementation of the design. By researching Hotjar, conducting a survey, digging through the
        testimonials and the contact moments with our support team we composed those goals:

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Set first steps towards event discovery.</li>
          <li>Start serving event recommendations to learn from user behaviour and improve the recommendation model.
          </li>
          <li>Increase retention of users.</li>

        <h4>Browse Events</h4>
        <p>
          Using the browse event features users can find the right event on the right day. During this project my task
          was to start small and take a close look at what we already could implement with the data and back-end we had.
          The result where 3 filters for location, category and the date.

        <h4>Event recommendations</h4>
        <p>
          The data scientists at TicketSwap have worked on creating a system that could recommend relevant events to
          users. This project was the first time we were going to implement it and show the recommendations to the
          users.
        </p><p>At TicketSwap we didn’t have a team that could work fulltime on curated content so I decided to make
          those recommendations the most prominent part of the app. The avatars of the artists already give some insight
          in what kind it is and also help to create a rich event card when there is no event image available.
        </p><p>
          [in the actual app the recommendations actually show up quite subtle, this decision was made based on
          technical constraints and will be improved in the future]
